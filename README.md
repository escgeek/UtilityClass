# UtilityClass

As a consultant there was one analogy that I thought of often. Think about a huge library that is so full of books that they have been stacked in the aisles and halls in a perfectly balanced maze that if bumped or disturbed will fall like domino's into a huge mess. Adding or creating code in existing org's is like walking around this huge library, very carefully. Changes have to be done in such a way as to not be disruptive to any and all of these stacks of books least it all fall into a huge mess. 

These tools are what I used to ensure that my code does what it needs to do without impacting not only what already existed but also future changes.

These utilities provide:

- Methods for doing Try/Catch on DML statements
- Methods for capture errors in a custom Errors object
- Methods to prevent Recursive Trigger Controls

This list also represents what I found a lot of org's were missing either some or all of these types of controls.
