# UtilityClass

As a consultant there was one analogy that I thought of often. Think about a huge library that is so full of books that they have been perfectly stacked in the aisles and halls in a perfectly balanced maze that if bumped or disturbed will fall like domino's into a huge mess. Adding or creating code in existing org's is like walking around this huge library. You have to do it in such a way as to not be disruptive to all of these stacks of books that are just waiting to fall. These tools are what I used to ensure that my code could do what it needed to do without impacting anything that existed already.

These utilities provide:

- Methods for doing Try/Catch on DML statements
- Methods for capture errors in a custom Errors object
- Methods to prevent Recursive Trigger Controls

This list also represents what I found a lot of org's were missing either some or all of these types of controls.
