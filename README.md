# UtilityClass

One analogy I liked to use was that working as a consultant in a clients org was like walking around a library surrounded by tall stacks of books. The trick was to not knock over any of the stacks of boxes or make any noise that would be disruptive.

And in doing projects across different clients I found a small list of things that needed addressing from time to time:

- Methods for doing Try/Catch on DML statements
- Methods for capture errors in a custom Errors object
- Methods to prevent Recursive Trigger Controls

This 'Utility Class' was created in order to help ensure that any code that was introduced by me had as little impact on the existing org as possible.
